<h1>SMS</h1>
<h2>Service decommissioned</h2>
<p>This page allowed to send SMS to Wolfplex members.</p>
<p>It was based on a script by Triskel, <a href="http://clochard.org/~triskel/contakt">contakt</a>.</p>
<p>The feature has been decommissioned, as it used Google Calendar notification instead of a rock solid API.<br />
Furthermore, changes to Google Calendar APIs make this feature obsolete.</p>

<h3>You need this service again?</h3>
<p>Build something with an API like Twilio, we'll be happy to run it.</p>
